ðŸ“Œ What is Huawei Map Kit?

Huawei Map Kit is a SDK for map development. It covers map data of more than 200 countries and regions, and supports dozens of languages. With this SDK, we can easily integrate map-based functions into your apps.
Map Kit uses the WGS 84 GPS coordinate system, which meets most map development requirements outside China, including:
Map display: Displays buildings, roads, water systems, and Points of Interest (POIs).
Map interaction: Controls the interaction gestures and buttons on the map.
Map drawing: Adds location markers, map layers, overlays, and various shapes.
